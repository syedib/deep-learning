Study Notes: Beyond Accuracy: Precision and Recall
Overview
From the Medium article Beyond Accuracy: Precision and Recall by Cassie Kozyrkov, these notes summarize key concepts for evaluating machine learning classification models, focusing on accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score, with emphasis on their practical implications.
Key Concepts
1. Accuracy

Definition: Proportion of correct predictions (true positives + true negatives) out of all predictions.
Formula:Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / (Total Predictions)
Limitation: Misleading for imbalanced datasets. Example: If 99% of cases are negative, a model predicting "negative" always can achieve 99% accuracy but fail to identify positives.
Use Case: Suitable when classes are balanced and errors (false positives/negatives) have similar costs.

2. Precision

Definition: Proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.
Formula:Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
Key Insight: Measures how often the model is correct when it predicts "positive." High precision minimizes false positives.
Example: In spam detection, high precision ensures emails flagged as spam are actually spam, reducing false alarms.
Use Case: Important when false positives are costly (e.g., incorrectly flagging a legitimate email as spam).

3. Recall (Sensitivity)

Definition: Proportion of actual positive cases correctly identified by the model.
Formula:Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
Key Insight: Measures how well the model captures all positive cases. High recall minimizes false negatives.
Example: In disease detection, high recall ensures most sick patients are identified, even if it means some false positives.
Use Case: Critical when missing positives is costly (e.g., failing to diagnose a disease).

4. Precision-Recall Trade-off

Adjusting the model’s decision threshold (e.g., probability cutoff for classifying "positive") affects precision and recall:
Lower threshold → Higher recall, lower precision (more positives caught, but more false positives).
Higher threshold → Higher precision, lower recall (fewer false positives, but more positives missed).


Analogy: Like a chef choosing apples for a pie—picky selection (high precision) may miss good apples (low recall), while loose selection (high recall) may include bad apples (low precision).

5. F1 Score

Definition: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics.
Formula:F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
Use Case: Useful when seeking a single metric for imbalanced datasets or when precision and recall are both important.
Note: F1 prioritizes balance, but the choice of metric depends on whether false positives or negatives are more costly.

6. Confusion Matrix

A table to visualize model performance:
True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted positives.
True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted negatives.
False Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted positives.
False Negatives (FN): Incorrectly predicted negatives.


Helps calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and identify error patterns.

Practical Takeaways

Context Matters: Choose metrics based on the problem’s goals and error costs:
High precision: Minimize false positives (e.g., spam filters).
High recall: Minimize false negatives (e.g., medical diagnosis).
F1 score: Balance precision and recall for imbalanced data.


Imbalanced Data: Accuracy alone is insufficient; use precision, recall, or F1 score.
Threshold Tuning: Adjust decision thresholds to optimize for precision or recall based on the application.

Key Questions to Ask

What are the costs of false positives vs. false negatives in this problem?
Is the dataset imbalanced? If so, prioritize precision, recall, or F1 over accuracy.
How does changing the decision threshold impact model performance?

Example Applications

Spam Detection: High precision to avoid flagging legitimate emails.
Disease Screening: High recall to catch as many cases as possible.
Fraud Detection: Balance precision and recall (F1 score) to catch fraud without too many false alarms.


Below is a textual representation of a mind map based on the study notes from the Medium article *Beyond Accuracy: Precision and Recall* by Cassie Kozyrkov. Since I cannot generate a visual mind map directly, I’ll structure it hierarchically with clear connections between concepts, which you can use to create a visual mind map using tools like XMind, Miro, or pen and paper. If you’d like, I can also suggest how to visualize it.

- **Formula**: (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Predictions
- **Strength**: Intuitive, works well for balanced datasets
- **Limitation**: Misleading for imbalanced datasets
  - Example: 99% negative cases → model predicting "negative" always gets 99% accuracy
- **Use Case**: When classes are balanced and error costs are similar

### Branch 2: Precision
- **Definition**: Proportion of correct positive predictions
- **Formula**: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

### Visualization Suggestions
To create a visual mind map:
1. **Central Node**: Place "Evaluating Classification Models" in the center (e.g., in a bold circle).
2. **Main Branches**: Draw 7 branches radiating outward for Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Precision-Recall Trade-off, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and Practical Considerations.
3. **Sub-branches**: Add sub-nodes for definitions, formulas, use cases, etc., using bullet points above. Use indentation or smaller nodes for details like examples or key insights.
4. **Colors**: Assign distinct colors to each branch (e.g., blue for Accuracy, green for Precision, red for Recall) for clarity.
5. **Connections**: Draw dotted lines between Precision and Recall to show their trade-off, and link Confusion Matrix to metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall) to indicate it’s their foundation.
6. **Tools**: Use software like XMind, MindMeister, or Canva, or sketch by hand with a central circle and branching lines.
