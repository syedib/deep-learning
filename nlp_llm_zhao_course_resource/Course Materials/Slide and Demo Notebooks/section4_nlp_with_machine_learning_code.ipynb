Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're \"probably\" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.

I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&amp;V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.</td>\n",
