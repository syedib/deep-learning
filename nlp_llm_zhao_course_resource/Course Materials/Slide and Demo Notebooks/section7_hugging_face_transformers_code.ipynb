So when Bonnie's beloved new craft-project-turned-toy, Forky (voice of Tony Hale), declares himself as \"trash\" and not a toy, Woody takes it upon himself to show Forky why he should embrace being a toy. But when Bonnie takes the whole gang on her family's road trip excursion, Woody ends up on an unexpected detour that includes a reunion with his long-lost friend Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts).
